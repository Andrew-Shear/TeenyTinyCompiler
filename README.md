Inspired by Austin Z. Henley's "Let's make a Teeny Tiny compiler" project. I initially implemented his design in Python, which can be found in pTT, but then decided to rewrite it in C before adding more features. Why? Because I hate fun.

To run:

`make compile` -- if you've altered the source files.

`make all` -- compiles all .teeny files in examples or in the main src folder.

Then all .teeny files will be executables. Enjoy!
